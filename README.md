# gears-shop
This is a website for shopping trendy and elite gears(wristwatches, clothings).
Gears shop is a Microverse Capstone project to demonstrate pure mastery of HTML/CSS and working with a CSS styling framework BOOTSTRAP. Much credit goes to Michael D of Behance, as this project is based off the layouts of the [Flowers Shop project](https://www.behance.net/gallery/69329213/Flower-e-shop). Also this project was built with SASS and compiled with Gulp.
